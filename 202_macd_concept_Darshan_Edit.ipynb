    "### MACD logic:\n",
    "- Moving average convergence/divergence (MACD, or MAC-D) is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship - between two moving averages (simple or exponential) of a securityâ€™s price. The MACD line is calculated by subtracting the 'long period moving average' from 'short period moving average'\n",
    "- Take for example below moving averages:\n",
    "- short moving average (window = 12, fast moving)\n",
    "- long moving average (window = 26, slow moving) \n",
    "- macd = short ma - long ma\n",
    "- signal line = ma of macd (window = 9)\n",

    "### Key Takeaway:\n",
    "-  MACD is best used with daily periods, where the traditional settings of 26/12/9 days is the norm.\n",
    "- MACD triggers technical signals when the MACD line crosses above the signal line (to buy) or falls below it (to sell).\n",
    "- MACD can help gauge whether a security is overbought or oversold, alerting traders to the strength of a directional move, and warning of a potential price reversal.\n",
    "- MACD can also alert investors to bullish/bearish divergences (e.g., when a new high in price is not confirmed by a new high in MACD, and vice versa), suggesting a potential failure and reversal.\n",
    "- After a signal line crossover, it is recommended to wait for three or four days to confirm that it is not a false move\n",
    "- When market trends are improving, short term averages will rise more quickly than long term averages. MACD line turn up\n",
    "- When market trands are losing strength, shorter term averages will tend to flatten, ultimately falling below longer term averages if declines continue. MACD line fall below 0\n",
    "- Weaking trends are reflected in changes of direction of MACD reading, but clear trend reversals are not usually considered as confirmed until other indications, which will be discussed, take place.\n",
    "- During the course of price movement, short term moving averages will move apart (diverge) and move together (converge) with longer term moving average- hence, the indicator name \"moving average convergence-divergence\"\n",

    "- The shorter the average the more sensitive will be the signal line.\n",

    "- Changes in MACD direction (from down to up and vice versa) and crossing of MACD lines above and below 0 carry significance.\n",
