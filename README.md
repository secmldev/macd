# MACD
#### Moving Average Convergence Divergence Indicator 
### MACD = short term exponential moving average - long term exponential moving average

    - When market trends are improving, short term averages will rise more quickly than long term averages. MACD line turn up
    - When market trands are losing strength, shorter term averages will tend to flatten, ultimately falling below longer term averages if declines continue. MACD line fall below 0
    - Weaking trends are reflected in changes of direction of MACD reading, but clear trend reversals are not usually considered as confirmed until other indications, which will be discussed, take place.
    - During the course of price movement, short term moving averages will move apart (diverge) and move together (converge) with longer term moving average- hence, the indicator name "moving average convergence-divergence"

* Signal Line
    - The signal line is an 'exponential average' of MACD levels, not of the price of the investment. 
    - Signal lines are usually created employing 3-day to 9-day exponential averages of MACD lines.
    - The shorter the average the more sensitive will be the signal line.

    - The shorter the average the more sensitive will be the signal line.
### Buy and Sell signal

    - Changes in MACD direction (from down to up and vice versa) and crossing of MACD lines above and below 0 carry significance.
    - Crosses of MACD from below to above its signal line and from above to below its signal line carry additional significance of their own.
    - As a general rule, crossing of MACD from below to above its signal line may be taken as confirmation of buy signals orignally indicated when changes in direction have taken places in MACD from down to up.
    - Signal line crossing take place after MACD lines change direction

# Moving Average Cross-over/Divergence (MACD)


## Overview

Moving average convergence/divergence is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two exponential moving averages (EMAs) of a security’s price.
- MACD = short term exponential moving average - long term exponential moving average
- When market trends are improving, short term averages will rise more quickly than long term averages. MACD line turn up
- When market trands are losing strength, shorter term averages will tend to flatten, ultimately falling below longer term averages if declines continue. MACD line fall below 0
- Weaking trends are reflected in changes of direction of MACD reading, but clear trend reversals are not usually considered as confirmed until other indications, which will be discussed, take place.
- During the course of price movement, short term moving averages will move apart (diverge) and move together (converge) with longer term moving average- hence, the indicator name "moving average convergence-divergence"

## Signal Line
  - The signal line is an exponential average of MACD levels, not of the price of the investment. 
  - Signal lines are usually created employing 3-day to 9-day exponential averages of MACD lines.
  - The shorter the average the more sensitive will be the signal line.

## Buy & Sell Signals
- Changes in MACD direction (from down to up and vice versa) and crossing of MACD lines above and below 0 carry significance.
- Crosses of MACD from below to above its signal line and from above to below its signal line carry additional significance of their own.
- As a general rule, crossing of MACD from below to above its signal line may be taken as confirmation of buy signals orignally indicated when changes in direction have taken places in MACD from down to up.
- Signal line crossing take place after MACD lines change direction
